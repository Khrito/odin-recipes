            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>On a recent warm Friday night, I had the good fortune to while away the time in the company of friends out on their deck. The theme for the evening was a Man-B-Q, a barbecue in which, as our host announced, "No girly things, such as vegetables, utensils, or napkins," were allowed. Guests were encouraged to bring side dishes to the Man-B-Q, as long as they were "meaty comestibles" to accompany the meat that would be grilled throughout the evening.</p>

            <p>What to bring to a Man-B-Q? The men I know love things like smoked ribs and beefy steaks, but then again, so do I. As I stood before my refrigerator and contemplated what to do, it dawned on me that the only logical thing to bring to a Man-B-Q is some part of a man. As luck would have it, I just happened to have a pair of testicles sitting in my freezer.</p>

        <div id="steps">
            <h2>Steps:</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Set up your grill, preferably charcoal, so that there's room on the grill to cook the testicles indirectly.</li>
                <li>Salt and pepper the testicles and place them on the grill for 10 to 15 minutes, until the outside surface is nicely charred. The tissue may burst during the process.</li>
                <li>When they are done, remove the testicles from the grill and cut into slices 1/3-inch thick. Garnish with lemon juice and more salt and pepper to taste.</li>
                <li>Cut the testicles int 1/3 inch slices, removing the membrane from each slice after it's cut. Set aside.</li>
                <li>Combine the egg with the mustard in a small bowl. Have the panko crumbs ready for dipping on the side.</li>
                <li>Heat the oil in a wok to 350Â°F.</li>
                <li>Dip each slice of testicles in the egg, then dip into the panko crumbs. Slip into the oil and fry from 1 to 2 minutes, until golden brown. Remove from the oil and place on a rack. Serve immediately, with lemon to garnish.</li>
            </ol>
