            <h2>Steps:</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Use a paper towel to pat the chicken breasts completely dry. Season with salt, pepper, and Italian seasoning.</li>
                <li>In a large skillet, heat oil over medium-high heat until the hot oil sizzles, about 1-2 minutes. Add chicken and sear until golden brown, 6-8 minutes per side. Set aside on a plate.</li>
                <li>In the same skillet, add butter and garlic and sauté until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add heavy cream, chicken broth, tomato paste, and Parmesan cheese. Mix well until smooth and bring the sauce to a simmer over medium heat, about 3-4 minutes.
                </li>
                <li>Stir in spinach and sun-dried tomatoes and cook until the spinach has wilted, about 1 minute.
                </li>
                <li>Return the chicken to the skillet and spoon some sauce over to coat. Let the chicken simmer in the sauce until the sauce has thickened to a desired consistency, about 3-4 minutes. Season with salt to taste.
                </li>
                <li>Serve immediately with pasta, rice, or potatoes.</li>
