# odin-recipes
The Odin Project - Recipe project

Goal: To demonstrate I have learnt the fundamentals of HTML.

Outcome: I think it turned out well, I was pretty comfortable with most aspects of putting together the webpages. Even though they are very simple. The only part I required to go back and double-check my notes was the Git workflow. After a few Git cycles I think I got a good grasp on how it works. 

Thing I could improve on were maybe trying to stick to atomic commits. I stuck to it at first but then I only ended up doing my final commit after I had created the last 2 pages. I think next time I could commit after each page?
